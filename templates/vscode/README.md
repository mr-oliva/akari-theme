A color theme inspired by Japanese alleys lit by round lanterns.

Akari (灯) means *light* in Japanese.
This theme is not about darkness, rain, or neon —
it is about warm light, quiet streets, and the presence of life.

## Variants

- **Akari Night** — Dark theme where lanterns are the primary light source
- **Akari Dawn** — Light theme, the same alley as the night fades into morning

## Color Philosophy

- **Light is singular** — Only one warm color (lantern orange) serves as the primary accent
- **Blue is air, not light** — Blue represents the night sky, not a light source
- **Purple stays quiet** — Muted purple for distance, never neon
- **Green is life** — Represents plants and human presence
- **Black is gray** — True black doesn't exist in a lit alley; use warm grays instead
